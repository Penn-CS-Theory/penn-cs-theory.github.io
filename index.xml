Title: High Dimensional Calibration for Rational Decision Making
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Foster and Vohra that decision makers that best respond to -fully calibrated- forecasts take actions that guarantee them no swap regret. Unfortunately the computational and data complexity of full distributional calibration is exponential in the dimension of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Shivam Nadimpalli</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/shivamn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/shivamn/</guid><description>The talk on 9/15 is by Shivam Nadimpalli.

Title: On the Pauli Spectrum of \mathsf{QAC}^0
Abstract: The circuit class \mathsf{QAC}^0 was introduced by Moore (1999) as a theoretical model for constant depth quantum circuits where many-qubit Toffoli gates are part of the gate set. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size \mathsf{QAC}^0 cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Kate Donahue</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kated/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kated/</guid><description>This week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar speaker is Kate Donahue of Cornell University.

Title: Stability, Optimality, and Fairness in Federated Learning
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents, each only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has recently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy rates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social good properties such as total error or fairness.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Jon Schneider</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/jons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/jons/</guid><description>The theory seminar will restart this week with a talk by Jon Schneider of Google Research.

Title: U-Calibration: Forecasting for an Unknown Agent
Abstract: We will discuss the problem of evaluating forecasts of binary events whose predictions are consumed by rational agents who take an action in response to a prediction, but whose utilities are unknown to the forecaster.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Mordecai Golin</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/modecaigolin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/modecaigolin/</guid><description>The speaker for this week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar is Mordecai Golin from HKUST.

Title: AIFV-m Coding and Finding the Cheapest Markov Chain Mordecai Golin. Hong Kong UST
Abstract: Binary AIFV-m codes are a relatively new method for lossless compression. They encode using an m-tuple of coding trees rather than the single tree used by Huffman coding. Their advantage is better proven redundancy than Huffman codes; their disadvantage is a slight decoding delay.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Sergei Vassilvitskii</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sergeivassilvitskii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sergeivassilvitskii/</guid><description>The speaker for the theory seminar on 4/28 is Sergei Vassilvitskii from Google.

Title: New advances in &amp;lsquo;Algorithms with Predictions&amp;rsquo;
Abstract: The theoretical study of algorithms and data structures has been bolstered by worst-case analysis, where we prove bounds on the running time, space, approximation ratio, competitive ratio, or other measure that holds even in the worst case. In practice, however, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework similar to what we have developed through worst-case analysis.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Abhishek Shetty</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/abhishekshetty/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/abhishekshetty/</guid><description>The speaker for this week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar is Abhishek Shetty from UC Berkeley.

Title: Optimal PAC Bounds without Uniform Convergence
Abstract: In statistical learning theory, determining the sample complexity of realizable binary classification for VC classes was a long-standing open problem. The results of Simon and Hanneke established sharp upper bounds in this setting. However, the reliance of their argument on the uniform convergence principle limits its applicability to more general learning settings such as multiclass classification.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Xi Chen</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/xichen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/xichen/</guid><description>The speaker for this week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar is Xi Chen from Columbia University. As usual, the talk will take place on Friday 4/14 at Levine 307 from 1-2 PM.
Title: Smoothed Complexity of SWAP for Graph Partitioning
Abstract: Many algorithms and heuristics that work well in practice have poor performance under the worst-case analysis, due to delicate pathological instances that one may never encounter. To bridge this theory-practice gap, Spielman and Teng introduced the smoothed analysis framework which can be viewed as a hybrid of the classical worst-case and average-case analyses.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Rajesh Jayaram</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/rajeshjayaram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/rajeshjayaram/</guid><description>Our speaker for the Theory Seminar on 4/7 will be Rajesh Jayaram of Google Research.

Title: Streaming Euclidean MST to a Constant Factor
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an n-point set X in R^d, where the points in X are presented in a stream. In low dimensions, (1+ε) approximations are possible in sublinear (in n) space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG &amp;lsquo;05].</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Zihan Tan</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/zihantan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/zihantan/</guid><description>The theory seminar is back in Levine 307 this Friday 3/24 at 1PM, featuring Zihan Tan from Rutgers University.
Title: A Subpolynomial Approximation Algorithm for Graph Crossing Number in Low-Degree Graphs
Abstract: Graph Crossing Number is a fundamental and extensively studied problem with wide ranging applications. In this problem, the goal is to draw an input graph G in the plane so as to minimize the number of crossings between the images of its edges.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Kamesh Munagala</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kamesh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kamesh/</guid><description>This week, to account for visit day, theory seminar will be on Thursday March 16 at noon (instead of Friday at 1PM).

Title: On Weighted Graph Sparsification by Linear Sketching
Abstract: A seminal work of [Ahn-Guha-McGregor, PODS'12] showed that one can compute a cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21].</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Sepehr Assadi</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that this week&amp;rsquo;s speaker is Sepehr Assadi.

Title: An Asymptotically Optimal Algorithm for Maximum Matching in Dynamic Streams
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the maximum matching problem in dynamic (insertion-deletions) streams with asymptotically optimal space complexity: for any n-vertex graph, our algorithm with high probability outputs an α-approximate matching in a single pass using O(n^2/α^3) bits of space.</description></item><item><title>People</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/people/</guid><description> Faculty Anindya De Boolean function analysis, Computational Complexity, Learning Theory Brett Hemenway Falk Cryptography, Coding Theory, Security Surbhi Goel Machine Learning, Learning Theory Sampath Kannan Algorithms for Big Data, Algorithmic Fairness, Computational Biology, Program Checking Michael Kearns Algorithmic Fairness, Algorithmic Game Theory, Machine Learning Sanjeev Khanna Approximation Algorithms, Combinatorial Optimization, Sublinear Algorithms Tal Rabin Blockchains, Cryptography, Secure Multiparty Computation Aaron Roth Algorithmic Fairness, Differential Privacy, Machine Learning Rakesh Vohra Mechanism Design, Auction Theory, Pricing Theory, Machine Learning Erik Waingarten Algorithms for Massive Datasets, Property Testing, Distribution Testing Postdocs Yahav Bechavod Jessica Sorrell Students Eshwar Ram Arunachaleshwaran Yiqiao Bao David L Cao Natalie Collina Markos Epitropou Ira Globus-Harris Varun Gupta Huan Li Georgy Noarov Prathamesh Patil Ramya Ramalingam Mirah Shi Nathan White Tian Zhang</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar Schedule</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/seminar/</guid><description>Below is a tentative list of speakers for Fall 2023, and we will announce all talks on the theory-group listserv.
