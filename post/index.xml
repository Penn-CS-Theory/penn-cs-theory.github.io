It will be held in the PCPSE (Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics), in the Dean’s forum on the second floor.
We are excited to have Kamesh Munagala from Duke speaking. Please find the abstract and bio below.
Abstract: We study the classical Bayesian auction setting with a twist: Between the revenue maximizing seller and the buyers lies an intermediary that is better informed about the buyer values.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Huan Li</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/huan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/huan/</guid><description>Our speaker for this week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar is Huan Li, a PhD student here at Penn.

Title: On Weighted Graph Sparsification by Linear Sketching
Abstract: A seminal work of [Ahn-Guha-McGregor, PODS'12] showed that one can compute a cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21].</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Sepehr Assadi</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that this week&amp;rsquo;s speaker is Sepehr Assadi.

Title: An Asymptotically Optimal Algorithm for Maximum Matching in Dynamic Streams
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the maximum matching problem in dynamic (insertion-deletions) streams with asymptotically optimal space complexity: for any n-vertex graph, our algorithm with high probability outputs an α-approximate matching in a single pass using O(n^2/α^3) bits of space.</description></item></channel></rss>
