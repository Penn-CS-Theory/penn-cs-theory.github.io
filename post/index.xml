Title: Smoothed Complexity of SWAP for Graph Partitioning
Abstract: Many algorithms and heuristics that work well in practice have poor performance under the worst-case analysis, due to delicate pathological instances that one may never encounter. To bridge this theory-practice gap, Spielman and Teng introduced the smoothed analysis framework which can be viewed as a hybrid of the classical worst-case and average-case analyses.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Rajesh Jayaram</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/rajeshjayaram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/rajeshjayaram/</guid><description>Our speaker for the Theory Seminar on 4/7 will be Rajesh Jayaram of Google Research.

Title: Streaming Euclidean MST to a Constant Factor
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an n-point set X in R^d, where the points in X are presented in a stream. In low dimensions, (1+ε) approximations are possible in sublinear (in n) space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG &amp;lsquo;05].</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Zihan Tan</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/zihantan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/zihantan/</guid><description>The theory seminar is back in Levine 307 this Friday 3/24 at 1PM, featuring Zihan Tan from Rutgers University.
Title: A Subpolynomial Approximation Algorithm for Graph Crossing Number in Low-Degree Graphs
Abstract: Graph Crossing Number is a fundamental and extensively studied problem with wide ranging applications. In this problem, the goal is to draw an input graph G in the plane so as to minimize the number of crossings between the images of its edges.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Kamesh Munagala</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kamesh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/kamesh/</guid><description>This week, to account for visit day, theory seminar will be on Thursday March 16 at noon (instead of Friday at 1PM). It will be held in the PCPSE (Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics), in the Dean’s forum on the second floor.
We are excited to have Kamesh Munagala from Duke speaking. Please find the abstract and bio below.
Abstract: We study the classical Bayesian auction setting with a twist: Between the revenue maximizing seller and the buyers lies an intermediary that is better informed about the buyer values.</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Huan Li</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/huan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/huan/</guid><description>Our speaker for this week&amp;rsquo;s theory seminar is Huan Li, a PhD student here at Penn. The talk will take place in Levine 307 on Friday 3/10 at 1pm.
Title: On Weighted Graph Sparsification by Linear Sketching
Abstract: A seminal work of [Ahn-Guha-McGregor, PODS'12] showed that one can compute a cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21].</description></item><item><title>Theory Seminar: Sepehr Assadi</title><link>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/sepehr/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that this week&amp;rsquo;s speaker is Sepehr Assadi.

Title: An Asymptotically Optimal Algorithm for Maximum Matching in Dynamic Streams
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the maximum matching problem in dynamic (insertion-deletions) streams with asymptotically optimal space complexity: for any n-vertex graph, our algorithm with high probability outputs an α-approximate matching in a single pass using O(n^2/α^3) bits of space.</description></item></channel></rss>
