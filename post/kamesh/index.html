The intermediary now segments the market by selectively releasing information to the seller, who still controls the auction. This process is called signaling and allows the seller to price discriminate. Though one would expect signaling to always help the seller, in the setting with one buyer, Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [AER 2015] showed a remarkable result: Signaling can maximally help the buyer without really helping the seller. Specifically, there exists a signaling scheme where the seller&rsquo;s revenue does not increase but the item always sells, thereby maximizing the consumer (buyer) surplus. In this talk, we will explore whether such a result is possible in more general settings: First, when the type space of the buyer is “inter-dimensional” with a private budget or deadline in addition to a private value, and second, when there are multiple buyers in the auction. On the positive side, we show exact and approximation results via new signaling schemes, while on the negative side, we show impossibility results that capture the limits to which information intermediaries can help the buyers.
