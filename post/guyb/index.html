Title: Subsampling Suffices for Adaptive Data Analysis
Abstract: Ensuring that analyses performed on a dataset are representative of the entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst&rsquo;s query and break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple, adaptively chosen, queries."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.125.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:url" content="https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/post/guyb/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Penn CS Theory Group"><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Guy Blanc"><meta property="og:description" content="This week&amp;rsquo;s speaker is Guy Blanc, from Stanford Univeristy.

Most classical techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst&rsquo;s query and break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple, adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of adaptive data analysis was formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS, 2014).</p><p>We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world scenarios not covered by prior work. We furthermore demonstrate the utility of this framework by designing a state of the art and extremely simple mechanism for answering statistical queries.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
