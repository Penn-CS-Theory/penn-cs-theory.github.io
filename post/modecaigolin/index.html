Title: AIFV-m Coding and Finding the Cheapest Markov Chain Mordecai Golin. Hong Kong UST
Abstract: Binary AIFV-m codes are a relatively new method for lossless compression. They encode using an m-tuple of coding trees rather than the single tree used by Huffman coding. Their advantage is better proven redundancy than Huffman codes; their disadvantage is a slight decoding delay."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.120.4"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Mordecai Golin"><meta property="og:description" content="The speaker for this week&rsquo;s theory seminar is Mordecai Golin from HKUST.

Mordecai Golin. Hong Kong UST</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
Binary AIFV-m codes are a relatively new method for lossless compression. They encode using an m-tuple of coding trees rather than the single tree used by Huffman coding. Their advantage is better proven redundancy than Huffman codes; their disadvantage is a slight decoding delay.</p><p>The compression rate of a binary AIFV-m code is the steady state average “gain” of an associated m-state Markov chain with rewards. Finding a best compression rate AIFV-m code is the problem of finding a minimum-gain Markov chain within an implicitly defined (exponentially large) collection of Markov chains.</p><p>Previous algorithms for solving this problem ran in exponential time. We show how to transform the problem to a Linear Programming one (with an exponential number of constraints). This LP problem can then be solved in polynomial time using binary search (for m=2) or the Ellipsoid method (for m >2). The technique maps all possible Markov chain states to hyperplanes that are then used to define the polytope for the LP problem. Since this polytope is only a function of the Markov chain structure, with almost no reliance on the original coding problem, the techniques developed might be of interest in other contexts.</p><p>This is joint work with Elfarouk Harb and Albert J.L.
