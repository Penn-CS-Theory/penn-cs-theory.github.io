Title: New advances in &lsquo;Algorithms with Predictions&rsquo;
Abstract: The theoretical study of algorithms and data structures has been bolstered by worst-case analysis, where we prove bounds on the running time, space, approximation ratio, competitive ratio, or other measure that holds even in the worst case. In practice, however, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework similar to what we have developed through worst-case analysis."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.123.8"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Sergei Vassilvitskii"><meta property="og:description" content="The speaker for the theory seminar on 4/28 is Sergei Vassilvitskii from Google.
