Title: Smoothed Complexity of SWAP for Graph Partitioning
Abstract: Many algorithms and heuristics that work well in practice have poor performance under the worst-case analysis, due to delicate pathological instances that one may never encounter. To bridge this theory-practice gap, Spielman and Teng introduced the smoothed analysis framework which can be viewed as a hybrid of the classical worst-case and average-case analyses."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.119.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Xi Chen"><meta property="og:description" content="The speaker for this week&rsquo;s theory seminar is Xi Chen from Columbia University.

To bridge this theory-practice gap, Spielman and Teng introduced the smoothed analysis framework which can be viewed as a hybrid of the classical worst-case and average-case analyses. Since then, the smoothed analysis of algorithms and problems from combinatorial optimization, among many other areas, has been studied extensively.</p><p>In this work, we give the first quasipolynomial upper bound for the smoothed complexity of the SWAP local search algorithm for Graph Partitioning, where one keeps swapping a pair of vertices to improve the cut weight until no such improvement can be made. The same quasipolynomial bound can also be shown to hold on the 2-FLIP algorithm for Max-Cut. Our results are based on an analysis of cycles formed in long sequences of swaps, showing that it is unlikely for every swap in a long sequence to incur a positive but small improvement in the cut weight.</p><p>Based on joint work with Chenghao Guo, Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis and Mihalis Yannakakis.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
