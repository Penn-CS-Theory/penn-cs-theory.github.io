Title: On the Pauli Spectrum of \mathsf{QAC}^0
Abstract: The circuit class \mathsf{QAC}^0 was introduced by Moore (1999) as a theoretical model for constant depth quantum circuits where many-qubit Toffoli gates are part of the gate set. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size \mathsf{QAC}^0 cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.123.8"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Shivam Nadimpalli"><meta property="og:description" content="The talk on 9/15 is by Shivam Nadimpalli.

More broadly, our results add evidence that &ldquo;Pauli-analytic&rdquo; techniques can be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.</p><p>The talk will assume no quantum background and will be self-contained.
