Title: U-Calibration: Forecasting for an Unknown Agent
Abstract: We will discuss the problem of evaluating forecasts of binary events whose predictions are consumed by rational agents who take an action in response to a prediction, but whose utilities are unknown to the forecaster."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.118.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Jon Schneider"><meta property="og:description" content="The theory seminar will restart this week with a talk by Jon Schneider of Google Research.

We will argue that two common classes of metrics for evaluating forecasts &ndash; scoring rules (e.g. the Brier score) and calibration &ndash; are in some sense inadequate, neither tightly characterizing when an unknown agent can trust the forecaster.</p><p>Motivated by this, we present a new efficiently-computable metric for evaluating forecasts that we call U-calibration, equal to the maximal regret of the sequence of forecasts when evaluated under any bounded scoring rule. We will show that sublinear U-calibration error is a necessary and sufficient condition for all agents to achieve sublinear regret guarantees. We will also demonstrate an online algorithm that achieves O(sqrt(T)) U-calibration error (on par with optimal rates for optimizing for a single scoring rule, and bypassing lower bounds for the traditionally calibrated learning procedures). Finally, we will discuss generalizations of U-calibration to the multiclass prediction setting and its connections to swap regret and strategizing in games.</p><p>Based on work with Robert Kleinberg, Renato Paes Leme, and Yifeng Teng.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
