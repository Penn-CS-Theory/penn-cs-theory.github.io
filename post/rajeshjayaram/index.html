Title: Streaming Euclidean MST to a Constant Factor
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an n-point set X in R^d, where the points in X are presented in a stream. In low dimensions, (1+ε) approximations are possible in sublinear (in n) space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG &lsquo;05]."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.114.1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.20b8a2d86dc4fda0308929d3b2e26e2bd0dd4405359d6ffed7a13f21487dfbc2.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Theory Seminar: Rajesh Jayaram"><meta property="og:description" content="Our speaker for the Theory Seminar on 4/7 will be Rajesh Jayaram of Google Research.

In low dimensions, (1+ε) approximations are possible in sublinear (in n) space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG &lsquo;05]. However, for high dimensional spaces the best known approximation was Õ(log n), due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC &lsquo;22], and prior to that it was O(log^2 n) due to [Indyk, STOC &lsquo;04] and [Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA &lsquo;08]. In this talk, we describe the first algorithm which achieves a constant factor approximation in sublinear space. Specifically, for any ε > 0, the algorithm obtains a Õ(1/ε^2) approximation in n^{O(ε)} space. We show that this is tight up to a constant, by proving a Ω(sqrt(n)) lower bound for any algorithm that beats a 1.1 approximation.</p><p>Joint work with Xi Chen, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Amit Levi, and Erik Waingarten (to appear in STOC &lsquo;23).<br>Paper: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06546>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06546</a></p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
